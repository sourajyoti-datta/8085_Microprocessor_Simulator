# About:
Microprocessors are generally very complicated integrated circuit chips which are a difficult
subject to teach. It is an important topic in computer architectures, as it is the fundamental part
of every computer system. Possibility of large calculations in a small amount of time,
programming capabilities and the potential to communicate with other devices has increased the
scale of applications the microprocessor has been used in. At the present time every intelligent
electronic device such as a mobile phone or a navigation system does contain some kind of
microprocessor. As a result of this every computer science student should know the general
architecture of microprocessor and how it manages and processes data, and controls other parts
of the system. Many methods for teaching microprocessors have been proposed, one important
method is simulation. Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary [2008] defines a simulation as-

“a model of a set of problems of events that can be used
to teach someone how to do something, or the process of
making such a model”

However, pure theoretical teaching of the subject does not fully clarify what the student is
expected to understand, and this is the time when simulation comes in, to bridge the gap between
the theory and the real word. One of the most valuable features of simulation is that students
have an opportunity to apply their theoretical knowledge in a safe realistic environment.
Microprocessor simulation reveals real situations of inner microprocessor processes. The
advantage of simulation is that user has a capability to graphically illustrate the whole process
and display the internal state at any time of the execution. Additionally, instructions can be
executed in a step-by-step method which stops the execution after each instruction, thus students
have an opportunity to identify the changes that have been made after each step.
